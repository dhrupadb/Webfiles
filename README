The scripts are fairly simple
1. It uses a counter to check when the sites been visited and updates it every time it's revisited. The count is kept in stats.txt
2. It then uses a script to determine which OS the user is using and displays it
3. Using the same logic as above it updates the counter for the OS of the type
4. Displays all the OSs from which the site has been accessed and their count.
